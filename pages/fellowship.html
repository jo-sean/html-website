                The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the
                fictional world of Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who
                long ago lost the One Ring that contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring
                and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth.
