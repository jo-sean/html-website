                The Two Towers opens with the disintegration of the Fellowship, as Merry and Pippin are taken captive by
                Orcs after the death of Boromir in battle. The Orcs, having heard a prophecy that a Hobbit will bear a
                Ring that gives universal power to its owner, wrongly think that Merry and Pippin are the Ring-bearers.
