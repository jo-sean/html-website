                The Return of the King, the third and final volume in The Lord of the Rings, opens as Gandalf and Pippin
                ride east to the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor, just after parting with King Théoden and the Riders of
                Rohan at the end of The Two Towers. In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Pippin meet Denethor, the city's
                Steward, or ruler, who clearly dislikes Gandalf. Pippin offers Denethor his sword in service to Gondor,
                out of gratitude for the fact that Denethor's son Boromir gave his life for the hobbits earlier in the
                quest.
